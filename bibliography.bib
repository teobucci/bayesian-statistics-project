  abstract = {A centred Gaussian model that is Markov with respect to an undirected graph G is characterised by the parameter set of its precision matrices which is the cone M+(G) of positive definite matrices with entries corresponding to the missing edges of G constrained to be equal to zero. In a Bayesian framework, the conjugate family for the precision parameter is the distribution with Wishart density with respect to the Lebesgue measure restricted to M+(G). We call this distribution the G-Wishart. When G is nondecomposable, the normalising constant of the G-Wishart cannot be computed in closed form. In this paper, we give a simple Monte Carlo method for computing this normalising constant. The main feature of our method is that the sampling distribution is exact and consists of a product of independent univariate standard normal and chi-squared distributions that can be read off the graph G. Computing this normalising constant is necessary for obtaining the posterior distribution of G or the marginal likelihood of the corresponding graphical Gaussian model. Our method also gives a way of sampling from the posterior distribution of the precision matrix.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of Bayesian inference for changepoints where the number and position of the changepoints are both unknown. In particular, we consider product partition models where it is possible to integrate out model parameters for the regime between each changepoint, leaving a posterior distribution over a latent vector indicating the presence or not of a changepoint at each observation. The same problem setting has been considered by Fearnhead (2006) where one can use filtering recursions to make exact inference. However, the complexity of this filtering recursions algorithm is quadratic in the number of observations. Our approach relies on an adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for finite discrete state spaces. We develop an adaptive algorithm which can learn from the past states of the Markov chain in order to build proposal distributions which can quickly discover where changepoint are likely to be located. We prove that our algorithm leaves the posterior distribution ergodic. Crucially, we demonstrate that our adaptive MCMC algorithm is viable for large datasets for which the filtering recursions approach is not. Moreover, we show that inference is possible in a reasonable time thus making Bayesian changepoint detection computationally efficient.},

  abstract = {Graphical models provide a powerful methodology for learning the conditional independence structure in multivariate data. Inference is often focused on estimating individual edges in the latent graph. Nonetheless, there is increasing interest in inferring more complex structures, such as communities, for multiple reasons, including more effective information retrieval and better interpretability. Stochastic blockmodels offer a powerful tool to detect such structure in a network. We thus propose to exploit advances in random graph theory and embed them within the graphical models framework. A consequence of this approach is the propagation of the uncertainty in graph estimation to large-scale structure learning. We consider Bayesian nonparametric stochastic blockmodels as priors on the graph. We extend such models to consider clique-based blocks and to multiple graph settings introducing a novel prior process based on a Dependent Dirichlet process. Moreover, we devise a tailored computation strategy of Bayes factors for block structure based on the Savage-Dickey ratio to test for presence of larger structure in a graph. We demonstrate our approach in simulations as well as on real data applications in finance and transcriptomics.},

  abstract = {Gaussian graphical models can capture complex dependency structures amongst variables. For such models, Bayesian inference is attractive as it provides principled ways to incorporate prior information and to quantify uncertainty through the posterior distribution. However, posterior computation under the conjugate G-Wishart prior distribution on the precision matrix is expensive for general non-decomposable graphs. We therefore propose a new Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method named the G-Wishart weighted proposal algorithm (WWA). WWA's distinctive features include delayed acceptance MCMC, Gibbs updates for the precision matrix and an informed proposal distribution on the graph space that enables embarrassingly parallel computations. Compared to existing approaches, WWA reduces the frequency of the relatively expensive sampling from the G-Wishart distribution. This results in faster MCMC convergence, improved MCMC mixing and reduced computation time. Numerical studies on simulated and real data show that WWA provides a more efficient tool for posterior inference than competing state-of-the-art MCMC algorithms.},

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in network analysis is clustering the nodes into groups which share a similar connectivity pattern. Existing algorithms for community detection assume the knowledge of the number of clusters or estimate it a priori using various selection criteria and subsequently estimate the community structure. Ignoring the uncertainty in the first stage may lead to erroneous clustering, particularly when the community structure is vague. We instead propose a coherent probabilistic framework for simultaneous estimation of the number of communities and the community structure, adapting recently developed Bayesian nonparametric techniques to network models. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is proposed which obviates the need to perform reversible jump MCMC on the number of clusters. The methodology is shown to outperform recently developed community detection algorithms in a variety of synthetic data examples and in benchmark real-datasets. Using an appropriate metric on the space of all configurations, we develop non-asymptotic Bayes risk bounds even when the number of clusters is unknown. Enroute, we develop concentration properties of non-linear functions of Bernoulli random variables, which may be of independent interest.},
