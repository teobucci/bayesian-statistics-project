\section{Introduction}

%First paragraph introducing GGM
Gaussian graphical models (GGM) are probabilistic models where undirected graphs are used to express the conditional dependence structure among variables with a joint Gaussian distribution. The vertexes of the graph represent the variables of the model, whereas the edges model the dependency between them. A crucial concept in GGM is the one of conditional independence: given a p-dimensional random vector $\mathbf{Y}$ distributed as a multivariate normal with zero mean and precision matrix $\mathbf{K}$, the random variables $Y_i$ and $Y_j$ are independent, conditionally on all the others, if and only if the corresponding entry in precision matrix $\mathbf{K}$ is null. This translates into the absence of a direct edge linking nodes $i$ and $j$ in the graph. 

The graph is usually unknown and must be learnt from the data. Following a Bayesian approach, the graph itself is considered a random variable, which can assume values in the space of all possible undirected graphs with p nodes. A common choice is to place a uniform prior distribution over such space. Furthermore, a prior on the precision matrix conditionally on the graph must also be introduced. Due to its conjugacy property, a G-Wishart distribution is often selected as a prior for the precision matrix.

%Use SBM as a prior to induce a block structure 
In many real-life applications, the variables of interest can be grouped into clusters, resulting in a block structure of the underlying graph. For instance, several biological problems require to identify groups of genes which regulate specific cellular functions (\textbf{ ref needed}). For this purpose, Stochastic Block Models (SBM) can be used to induce a block structure in the adjacency matrix of a graph. More in detail, SBM are generative models for random networks with wide applications in the context of community detection, as they allow to cluster the nodes of a graph into mutually exclusive groups that share similar connectivity patterns and are not known a priori. Most importantly, in SBM the probability of having an edge between two nodes only depends on the group membership of the nodes. Of note, the clustering automatically induces a partition on the nodes; therefore, the space of possible graph is isomorphic to the space of possible partitions, and specifying the prior of the graph is equivalent to introduce a prior on the partition.

%Additional specification on the order of the partition - IN PROGRESS -
One additional constraint that may exist in real contexts (\textbf{should we mention /quote some of them?}) is that the variables present some predefined order which cannot be ignored when identifying clusters. This limits the admissible partitions to the ones where the order is preserved.

%Introduce the goal of the project
In this project, we propose a flexible prior that allows to infere a block-structured graph while respecting an ordering constraint on the nodes. To do so, we build upon the theory of changepoint models from the works of Benson \cite{bensonAdaptiveMCMCMultiple2018} and Martinez \cite{martinezNonparametricChangePoint2014}, borrowing some ideas concerning the prior on the partition and relying on an adaptive approach. 

%Details on the structure
In the next two sections, we introduce the proposed model and describe the sampling strategy, which relies on a two-block Gibbs sampler to update the graph and the partition. Then, we present the main results of our simulations. Finally, we perform a critical analysis of our results and discuss the limitations of the current work, while also identifying potential directions for future investigation.
